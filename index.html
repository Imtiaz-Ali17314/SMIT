      <h2>🌱 Early Education</h2>
      <p>I began my education in my native village <strong>Phakar</strong>, studying from <em>Nursery to 8th grade</em> at the well-known <strong>Uswa Public School</strong>.</p>
      <p>At that time, students from <strong>Jamia Urwa-tul-Wusqa, Lahore</strong> used to visit villages during summer vacations and run <strong>classes and workshops</strong> for children — creating a spiritual, academic, and worshipful environment.</p>

      <h2>🕌 Journey Towards Madrsa</h2>
      <p>Together with students of Jamia Urwa-tul-Wusqa I travelled to Lahore. In Rawalpindi I know about <strong>Jamia Jafria Gujranwala</strong> (a branch). Impressed by its system, I joined there.</p>

      <h3>Daily Schedule at Jamia Jafria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>⏰ Wake-up: 30 minutes before Fajr</li>
        <li>🕌 Prayer: Immediately after Adhan</li>
        <li>🏃 Exercise → 🍽️ Breakfast → 🎤 Assembly</li>
        <li>📚 Classes until Zuhr</li>
        <li>🍴 Lunch → 😴 Rest (2–3 hours)</li>
        <li>📖 Study till Maghrib</li>
        <li>🍽️ Dinner → 💬 Discussions till 10 PM</li>
        <li>🌙 Rest for the night</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I studied there for <strong>2 years</strong> and completed <strong>Matriculation</strong> with <strong>77% marks</strong> (2nd position in Bio-Science, Jamia Jafria 10<sup>th</sup>class). As Jamia Jafria offered education up to Matric only, I was sent to <strong>Jamia Urwat-ul-Wusqa, Lahore</strong> for higher studies.</p>

      <h2>🎓 Higher Education</h2>
      <p>At <strong>Jamia Urwa-tul-Wusqa, Lahore</strong> I continued religious studies for <strong>5 years</strong> and earned the <strong>Almiyah Degree</strong> (equivalent to M.A).</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, I completed <strong>Intermediate</strong> from the <strong>Lahore Board</strong> in <strong>May 2021</strong>, achieving <strong>1036/1100 marks</strong> (1st Position in the Jamia). 🏆🌟</p>

      <h2>💻 Introduction to IT</h2>
      <p>An IT expert joined the Jamia as Head of IT and launched IT courses. Although I initially hesitated, I quickly enrolled once I learned the courses were computer-related.</p>
      <p>Having loved computers since childhood (I even bought my first PC during school), I had served as <strong>In-charge of the Computer Lab</strong> at Jamia Jafria. After passing a selection test, I joined the <strong>Modern Web Application Development</strong> course and completed it while continuing religious studies.</p>

      <h2>💼 Professional Development</h2>
      <p>I worked about <strong>1.5 years</strong> in Jamia's IT department where I learned <strong>Networking</strong>, <strong>Hardware</strong>, and <strong>Web Development</strong>. I also completed online courses in <strong>Freelancing</strong>, <strong>WordPress Development</strong>, and <strong>Graphic Designing</strong>.</p>
      <p>After moving to <strong>Karachi</strong>, I reconnected with my trainer who brought me into his development company. I completed internships and fast-tracked courses in <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>, then started working on live projects.</p>
      <p>I also joined the <strong>Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT)</strong> program in Modern Web Application Development after passing a competitive test and am continuing my studies at the SMIT head office in Bahadurabad, Karachi.</p>

      <h2>📢 Teaching & Preaching Experience</h2>
      <p>To develop my preaching and community skills, I served for <strong>two years</strong> at <strong>Darul Uloom Hujjatiya, Gilgit</strong> (a branch of Jamia Urwat-ul-Wusqa). During this time my web development work paused, but my interest in software development remained strong.</p>
